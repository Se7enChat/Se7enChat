Se7enChat is a web-based chat written from the ground up with good software design in mind. Our goals are to keep the code base clean and well tested with frequent refactoring, as well as provide a great user experience with modern technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.

If you wish to contribute to the project, you may fork us on GitHub and submit a pull request. However, please remember that Se7enChat is strict about unit testing, and expects all contributed code to be adequately tested using PHPUnit.
